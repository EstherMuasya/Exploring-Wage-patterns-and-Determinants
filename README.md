## 📊 Salaries & Wages Data Analysis
## Overview

This project analyzes a salaries and wages dataset (NLSW88) to understand how education, experience, industry, and location influence employee compensation. Python is used to clean, explore, and visualize the data to extract actionable insights.

## Dataset Description
The project uses the NLSW88 dataset, which contains demographic, education, work history, and wage information for over 2,000 individuals. Key variables include wage, age, grade (education), total experience (ttl_exp), tenure, hours worked, industry, and location indicators. The dataset supports analysis of how personal and professional factors impact earnings.

## Objectives

- Explore wage distribution and key pay drivers.
- Analyze the impact of education, experience, and tenure on wages.
- Compare workforce experience across industries and locations.

## Tools
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **upyter Notebook**

## Process

- Cleaned and prepared the dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Built visualizations to study wage, experience, and education patterns.

## Key Insights

- Wages increase with higher education and experience.

- Industry and location influence workforce maturity.

- Wage distribution is skewed with noticeable outliers.

## Recommendations

- Invest in employee education and skills development programs.

- Improve retention strategies to benefit from tenure-based productivity.

- Benchmark pay structures across industries and regions.

- Monitor wage inequality to promote fair compensation policies.

## Conclusion
The analysis shows that compensation is driven mainly by human capital factors—education, experience, and tenure—rather than age alone. Industry and location further shape wage outcomes, while wage inequality highlights the need for structured, data-driven pay strategies. These insights can guide organizations in building equitable and competitive compensation frameworks.
